# <p align = "center"> [Games_website](https://randomguy70.github.io/games_website/) </p>
## A website created by JohnPaul Malloy in order to learn and experiment with JS, HTML, and CSS, as well as to host his [JS games online](https://randomguy70.github.io/games_website/).
### This is my first website ever, so please forgive the egregious lack of content! 
### P.S. The first game (Flappy Beaver), is linked to the khan academy processing JS website where my code is. I will change that soon (as soon as I know how) so that any user can play the game directly inside of my website.
