## I coded this website from scratch in HTML, CSS, and (a little) JS. However, I took inspiration from several expertly done sites and used some publicly available JS for small things such as the [terminal text animation](https://github.com/randomguy70/games_website/blob/cf7befaf2b50c446ad38d17b4d52ed5ef38f3ad0/scripts/underscore_text.js#L1). 

## Because Github pages doesn't seem to allow certain libraries such as jQuery and because I don't have a hosting and serving setup (that will change soon), it is advisable to load this website from a virtual server. Otherwise, the website will look pretty strange.

# To Run:

1. Clone the [repository] (https://github.com/randomguy70/games_website)
2. navigate to the root directory in the repository in your terminal
3. Activate the built-in virtual server in your terminal by running this script: python -m SimpleHTTPServer
4. Open a new page in your browser and type in this: http://127.0.0.1:8000
5. The website should load correctly if you have internet. If you don't have internet, which is unlikely given the fact that you had to download the repository to run it, then functions which rely on jQuery (such as the sidebar) won't run correctly.

## Thank you for your time! Enjoy my first website ever, and make sure to give a star to the [github repo](https://github.com/randomguy70/games_website)!
