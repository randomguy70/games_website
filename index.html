			Flappy Beaver

	<p id="rcorners3">
		This is a spinoff of a flappy bird game. The player controls a beaver to collect sticks and avoid ghosts and other enemies while staying off the ground. The longer the player survives, and the more sticks they collect, the more points they will be awarded. I am planning to implement highscores later when I actually can optimise the game and improve the graphics (there is a ton that I need to work on). But for now, enjoy the first game that I ever programmed!
